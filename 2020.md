## Whitelisting and Censorship of Information:

If Facebook were an open platform of liberty, it would not censor information with any specific whitelist,
but allow the reader to delegate the judging of articles and their veracity to any third party service(s).
It doesn’t matter whether they cede control to a whitelist or not, the structural incentive problems are still there,
for publishers will ultimately do the bidding of Facebook to stay in the whitelist.
Instead, articles should be accompanied by a sidebar that shows information about veracity, where Facebook
is free to include their preferred analysis on top -- it really doesn’t matter as long as it’s clear that
the user can include their own analysis services.  The problem with the whitelist is that it is able to censor
information by not showing it at all, which is an immense power that necessarily will be abused. Like the credit
default swaps created a structural incentive for banks to create an asset bubble, likewise Facebook has set
itself up to be the arbiter of attention and judgement. This will change, as people become more aware of the
incentives at play.  If Facebook does not transform from within, it will quickly become obsolete.
The same applies to other media services like Twitter or Reddit.

(This also applies to the accountability of sorting algorithms, as well as other elements of UX as well, one of which is mentioned above)

Meanwhile, the blockchain will bring censorship resistant information retrieval in the hands of every developer
and technologist in China.  The coming global economic recession may cause a shift in public opinion about their
economic prospects.  By that time, blockchain technology will be well established to enable censorship resistant
information sharing.  This is inevitable, based on the nature of epidemic gossip protocols, and the capability of
the Chinese developer community.  Censorship is a power that necessarily will get abused, and I’m concerned that
the situation in China is like that of a tinderbox -- the good people of China may have a sudden explosive
reaction in the face of uncensored information.  Therefore I believe that recent events like those in Hong Kong
should not be resisted (because resistance creates a reaction of strengthening of the movement, as the movement
becomes legitimized in the minds of the protesters).  Instead, I sincerely hope that the Chinese government will
step back a bit, to not just tolerate but enable the voluntary organization of people of Hong Kong, to provide
them a radically transparent platform for voice, such that a canonical Socratic dialog can happen in public
between the Chinese government and the people of Hong Kong, and likewise from within.  Hong Kong is an opportunity
to test a new paradigm of governance in a sandbox, one with core values of transparency and freedom of speech.
The situation can only resolve itself if everyone feels that their voice is heard and accounted for.
I suspect that when this is done well, the eventual outcome will even be surprisingly positive.
